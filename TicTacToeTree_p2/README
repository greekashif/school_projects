This program generates all the possible moves given a certain board position
in the game Tic-Tac-Toe.

I chose to generate the tree using preorder style algorithm. Starting at
the root, I generate all the possible first moves which are added to a vector.
Then I recursively call the same function on each of these children and their
descendents and so on until the game is won or tied. After this, I traverse
the tree using a level order algorithm with the C++ STL <queue> data structure
for convenience.
I chose the Node and Tree data types to be classes to preserve data integrity
as much as possible.
