Design Document Critique

Loading and reading the image files was pretty straightforward 
and the design doc helped organize this nicely. But I needed
a bit more detail on how to approach manipulating the pixels.
I was far too vague in this respect.

The manner in which I manipulated the pixels doesn't sit well
with me. It seems incredibly inefficient to create a new
object (Color) when going each element of a 2D array. I guess
it is passable for small images, but I can't image it scaling
well in higher resolutions. I think manipulating the image buffer
using the ColorModel class may be a better approach.
