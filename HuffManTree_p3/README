This program builds a Huffman encoding table from a sample text file.
From the table the program can encode/decode user defined messages.

I decided to use a Node class to store each letter and combination of letters
and their frequencies in order to preserve data integrity. For similar reasons
I used a Tree class to hold the nodes of the frequency char. I stored the nodes
in a vector, because manipulation with vectors is straight-forward and flexible.


To compile: type 'make'
To run:		type './a.out'
To clean: 	type 'make clean'
